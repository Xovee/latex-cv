## Usage

The use of this template should be fairly straightforward: see [cv.tex](https://github.com/Xovee/latex-cv/blob/main/cv.tex).

### Font

In this template, `ebgaramond` font has been used. I personally used [`garamondx`](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/garamondx), you need additional steps to install this font (by using `getnonfreefonts`). Of course, you can always adopt other fonts in your favor. 

### BibTeX

If you want to use `bibtex` or other similar packages, create your bibliography file `.bib` and import it into `cv.tex`, rather than manually type articles as I did in this template. 

## Quick TIP

- Less (formant) is often more. Consistency is critical.
