## Usage

The use of this template should be fairly straightforward: see `cv.tex`.

### Font

In this template, `ebgaramond` font has been used. I personally used `garamondx`, you need additional steps to install this font. Of course, you can easily adopt other kinds of fonts. 

### BibTeX

If you want to use `bibtex` or other similar packages, create your bibliography file `.bib` and import it into `cv.tex`, rather than manually type articles which I did in this template.
